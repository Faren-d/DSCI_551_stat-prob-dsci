# Lab Mechanics

rubric={mechanics:5}

Check off that you have read and followed each of these instructions:

- [ ] All files necessary to run your work must be pushed to your `GitHub.ubc.ca` repository for this lab.
- [ ] Paste the URL to your GitHub repo here: **INSERT YOUR GITHUB REPO URL HERE**
- [ ] You need to have **a minimum of 3 commit messages** associated with your `GitHub.ubc.ca` repository for this lab.
- [ ] **You must also submit `.Rmd` file and the rendered `pdf` in this lab to Gradescope.** You are responsible for ensuring all the figures, texts, and equations in the `.pdf` file are appropriately rendered.
- [ ] To ensure you do not break the autograder remove all code for installing packages (i.e., DO NOT have `install.packages(...)` or `devtools::install_github(...)` in your homework!
- [ ] Follow the [**MDS general lab instructions**](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/general_lab_instructions/).

This lab has hidden tests. In this lab, the visible tests are just there to ensure you create an object with the correct name. The remaining tests are hidden intentionally. This is so you get practice deciding when you have provided the right numeric or text answer. This is a necessary skill for data scientists, and if we were to provide robust visible tests for all questions you would not develop this skill, or at least not to its full potential.

> **Important:** For the assignments, you are permitted to use LLMs only to gather information, review concepts, or brainstorm. You **must cite** these tools if you use them for the assignment. It is not permitted to write any given assignment by copying and pasting AI-generated responses.

# One-time set-up

If you are using the `testthat` and `digest` packages for the first time and have never installed them before, do this:

1. Uncomment the two lines of code below by deleting the `# ` at the start of each line.
2. Run the code cell, which will perform the installation.
3. Comment the two lines of code again by adding the `# ` back to the start of each line.

```{r}
# install.packages("testthat")
# install.packages("digest")
```

# A Note on Challenging Questions

Each lab will have a few challenging questions. **These are usually low-risk questions and will contribute to a 5% out of the total lab grade of 100%**. The main purpose here is to challenge yourself or dig deeper in a particular area. When you start working on labs, attempt all other questions before moving to these questions. If you are running out of time, please skip these questions.

We will be more strict with the marking of these questions. If you want to get full points in these questions, your answers need to

- be thorough, thoughtful, and well-written (if necessary),
- provide convincing justification and appropriate evidence for the claims you make, and
- impress the reader of your lab with your understanding of the material, your analytical and critical reasoning skills, and your ability to think on your own.

# A Note on Warmup Exercises

Each lab session will begin with a warmup exercise, which will be indicated when introduced in the handout. We will solve this exercise altogether during the first 10 minutes of the lab session. 

> **Note this warmup part will not count toward the lab grade of 100%.**

# (Warmup) Exercise 1: Collective Risk

The BC government is assessing the risk of flu infection in a social gathering. As a data scientist, you are tasked with developing a probabilistic model to estimate the risk of the gathering. **Assuming the total population in BC is 5 million people**, of which 5,000 people have flu on a given day:

**1.1.** What is the probability that a randomly chosen person is infected with flu on a given day in BC?

**1.2.** What is the probability that a randomly chosen person is **not** infected with the flu on a given day in BC?

**1.3.** If we have a gathering of 20 people (e.g., a coffee shop), what is the probability that **at least** one person is infected with the flu?

**1.4.** Now, if we have a gathering of 200 people (e.g., a large lecture hall), what is the probability that **at least** one person is infected with the flu?

> **Note:** For **1.3** and **1.4**, we will assume that each person is **independent** from one another. Recall that if two events $A$ and $B$ are independent, then:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B).$$

# Exercise 2: The Slot Machine

Suppose a slot machine costs \$5 to play (call one pull of the lever a "game"). You win nothing with a probability of 0.9, \$10 with a probability of 0.09, and \$50 with a probability of 0.01. Let $X$ be the **net gain** in one game. Then $X$ has the following distribution:

| $X$ (net gain in one game) | -\$5 | \$5 | \$45 |
| ---                     | --    | --   | --    |
| **Probability**             | 0.9   | 0.09 | 0.01  |

## 2.1.

rubric={autograde:5,reasoning:5}

Find the following quantities:

**2.1.1.** The expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$.

**2.1.2.** $P[X = \mathbb{E}(X)]$, i.e., the probability that you achieve the average outcome in a single game.

**2.1.3.** $P(X < 0)$, i.e., the probability of losing money in a game.

**2.1.4.** The mode of $X$.

**2.1.5.** The variance $\operatorname{Var}(X)$.

Now suppose you play the game 100 times. Assuming we have an infinite supply of money (so that we can always afford to play the game!), the net outcome after 100 games can be written as a new random variable:

$$Z = \sum_{i = 1}^{100} X_i,$$ 

where all $X_i$s are **identically distributed** random variables with the same distribution as $X$ in **question 2.1**.

Find the following quantities:

**2.2.1.** The maximum value of $Z$.

**2.2.2.** The minimum value of $Z$.

You may find the `choose(n, k)` function useful. This function calculates how many ways can we choose a $k$ subset (no repetition) of an $n$ set, or in math, $\binom{n}{k}$.

# Excercise 4: The Vancouver Whitecaps Football Club

rubric={autograde:8}

The odds of a particular event reflect the likelihood that the event will take place. Odds can be calculated as: 

$$\frac{\text{number of favorable events}}{\text{number of unfavorable events}}$$

or 

$$\frac{p}{1 - p},$$ 

where $p$ is the probability of the event occurring. **In our statistical context, note that odds are not probabilities.**

Say that the Vancouver Whitecaps Football Club (a past MDS Capstone partner!) won 10 out of 34 games last season. You want to use this information to predict their performance in the first game of the upcoming season. Let us assume they continue with the same win rate this season.

Answer the following:

**4.1.** What is the probability of the Whitecaps winning the game?

**4.2.** What are the odds **in favour** of the Whitecaps winning the game? Provide the corresponding ratio.

**4.3.** What are the odds **against** the Whitecaps winning the game? Provide the corresponding ratio.

**4.4.** If a sports website states that the odds in favour of the Whitecaps winning the game is 3:4, what is the probability they win the game (according to the sports website)?

**4.5.** If $P(\text{winning}) \leq 0.5$ what is the maximum odds?

**4.6.** If $P(\text{winning}) > 0.5$ what is the maximum odds?

**4.7.** Questions **4.5** and **4.6** hopefully showed you that odds are not symmetrical. This makes it difficult to compare the odds in favour of an event to the odds against an event. Instead, we can take the natural logarithm of the odds to make them symmetrical. The log of the odds is called the **logit function** and allows us to map probabilities from the range $[0, 1]$ to the full range of real numbers. Therefore, what is the log of the odds 10:24?

> **Heads-up:** The **logit function** is the basis of **logistic regression**, which you will learn about later in the program. 

**4.8.** Finally, what is the log of the odds 24:10?

Assign your **numeric answers** to `answer4_1`, `answer4_2`, ..., `answer4_7`, and `answer4_8`. **Code your computations directly in each answer if necessary.** You do not need to provide all your procedure (i.e., equations!) to get full marks.

## Challenging

rubric={reasoning:3}

In **binary logistic regression**, we aim to model a set of regressors or features (namely, the $X$s) versus a **binary response** (e.g., win or loss) where the event of interest (e.g., win) has a probability $p$. If we have a single regressor $X$, we call our model **simple binary logistic regression**. In this case, $p$ will be in function of $X$: $p(X)$. Moreover, we also include **regression parameters** in a linear function: an intercept $\beta_0$ and a coefficient $\beta_1$.

The model is set up as

$$\log \bigg[ \frac{p(X)}{1 - p(X)} \bigg] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X.$$ 

Rearrange the equation above with a standalone $p(X)$ on the left-hand side. 

**To get full marks, show all your work.** Thus, provide all your procedure and/or reasoning (e.g., equations):

Consider a weighted 6-sided die with probabilities $p_1,\dots, p_6$. Answer the following **in two or three sentences per item**:

**5.1.** What values of the $\{p_i\}$ ($i = 1, \dots, 6$) do lead to the highest entropy distribution? Is the answer unique? Why or why not?

# Exercise 6: Choose the Distribution

## 6.1.

rubric={autograde:5}

For each of the following definitions of a random variable, select the appropriate discrete distribution family from these ones: `"Bernoulli"`, `"Binomial"`, `"Poisson"`, or `"Categorical"` (where "categorical" is any discrete distribution with a finite amount of outcomes).

> **Heads-up**: We are actually asking for the *smallest* family here. For example, the family of Bernoulli distributions is contained within the family of Binomial distributions (by taking $n = 1$ trials). Still, if a random variable here belongs to the Bernoulli family, we expect you to respond with `"Bernoulli"`. 

**6.1.1.** The outcome of a coin flip.

**6.1.2.** The outcome of a 6-sided die roll.

**6.1.3.** The number of heads in 10 coin flips.

**6.1.4.** The number of times we saw a 6 out of 10 die rolls.

**6.1.5.** The number of times a professor says *"um"* in a lecture.

Assign your **answers as strings with the name of the distribution between quotation marks** to `answer6_1_1`, `answer6_1_2`, `answer6_1_3`, `answer6_1_4`, and `answer6_1_5`. Moreover, run the test below to validate your answers.

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Q6-1.R")

## 6.2.

rubric={reasoning:2}

When discussing the binomial distribution, we often use the letters $p$, $n$ and $x$. For example, let X be a binomial random variable

$$X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, p).$$

> **Heads-up:** *The symbol "$\sim$" means "is distributed as."*

Its PMF is defined as:

$$P(X = x \mid n, p) = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1 - p)^{n - x}.$$

Are $p$, $n$, and $x$ all parameters of the binomial distribution? Or is one of them different from the other two? Explain **in two or three sentences**.

# Exercise 7

rubric={autograde:5}

Consider three events

$$A, B, \text{and } C.$$

Suppose that 

$$P(A) = 0.12,$$
$$P(B) = 0.07,$$ 
$$P(C)=0.05,$$
$$P(A \cup B ) = 0.13,$$ 
$$P(A \cap C ) = 0.04,$$ 
$$P(B \cap C ) = 0.01,$$ 
and
$$P(A \cap B \cap C) = 0.01.$$

Compute the following probabilities: 

**7.1.** $P(A^c)$. 

**7.2.** $P(A \cap B)$.

**7.3.** $P(A \cap B \cap C^c)$.

**7.4.** $P[(A \cup B \cup C)^c]$.

**7.5.** $P(A \cup B \cup C^c)$.

> **Hint:** It may help to draw a Venn diagram of the events. [**Check this resource**](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/compound-probability/index.html#section1). Suppose you have an event $A$, note that notation $A^c$ is equivalent to $A'$.

# (Challenging) Exercise 8

rubric={autograde:2,reasoning:2}

Let $X$ be a discrete random variable defined on the positive integers ($i = 1, 2, 3,\dots$), with the following PMF:

$$P(X = i) = \frac{C}{i^2} \qquad \text{for some normalizing constant } C.$$ 

> **Heads-up:** It turns out that $C = \frac{6}{\pi^2} \approx 0.61$. We could have at least reasoned that $C < 1$, since otherwise we would have $P(X = 1) \geq 1$, which does not make sense.

Find the following quantities:

**8.1.** $P(X < 5)$.

**8.2.** $P(X > 2 \cup X < 4)$.

**8.3.** $P(X < 2 \cup X < 4)$.

**8.4.** $P(X > 2 \cup X > 4)$.

**8.5.** $P(X < 2 \cup X > 4)$.

**8.6.** $P(X > 2 \cap X < 4)$.

**8.7.** $P(X < 2 \cap X < 4)$.

**8.8.** $P(X > 2 \cap X > 4)$.
