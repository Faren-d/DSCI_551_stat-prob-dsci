Welcome to DSCI 551: Descriptive Statistics and Probability for Data Science
============================

This course introduces descriptive statistics and probability, including measures of location and spread, random variables, distributions, parameters, categorical variables, and uncertainty.

## High-Level Goals

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

- Provide fundamental concepts in probability, including conditional, joint, and marginal distributions.
- Develop a statistical view of data coming from a probability distribution.

## Learning Objectives

- Compute summary statistics, such as expected value and variance, of simple discrete and continuous probability distributions.
- Compare/contrast location summary statistics such as mean/median/mode/quantiles.
- Estimate summary statistics such as mean/median/variance from a plot of a distribution's PDF or CDF.
- Identify common continuous distributions such as Gaussian/Poisson/uniform from a plot of a distribution's PDF or CDF.
- Match common discrete distributions such as Bernoulli/binomial/multinomial to descriptions.
- Compare/contrast conditional, joint and marginal distributions. 
- Explain the notion of "marginalizing out" a random variable.
- Identify independence between random variables from plots/tables of conditional/joint/marginal distributions.
- Connect conditional distributions to the notion of supervised learning.
- Identify the units of various quantities such as mean/variance/density for continuous distributions.
- Simulate sample generation from probability distributions, and interpret the results.

## Communication 

We will use **Slack** as the main communication channel.

If you have any questions regarding the course content, lectures, labs, autograders, or any other course-related matters, we kindly request that you avoid direct messaging (DM) the instructor or TAs. Instead, please post your question on the #551 channel. This approach not only enables our TAs to respond promptly but also benefits other students who might have similar questions.

> **Response time:** We will try our best to reply to your inquiries as soon as possible during the normal working hours (9AM-5PM Mon-Fri). If you send us a message outside of regular working hours, please expect a response on the next working day.

## Use of LLMs

LLMs, such as ChatGPT, can be helpful tools if we use them responsibly. In this course, students are permitted to use these tools to gather more information, review concepts, or brainstorm, and students must cite these tools if they use them for assignment. Having said all this, it is **not** permitted to write any given assignment via copying and pasting AI-generated responses.
